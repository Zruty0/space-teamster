# Rig Maintenance Components

Confirmed component catalog for the persistent rig maintenance system. Global HP/AP, grade, strike, threshold, service, repair, and replacement rules are defined in `non-flight-interaction-plan.md`.

## Body and Frame

### Main Chassis

- **ID:** `body-main-chassis`
- **Function:** Primary load-bearing frame carrying thrust, landing, docking, and cargo stresses through the rig.
- **Grade-D HP/AP:** `6/4`
- **Grade-D cost:** `120,000 cr`
- **Minor threshold:** `4 HP`
- **Major threshold:** `2 HP`
- **Total threshold:** `0 HP`
- **Replacement labor:** `24 hours`
- **Fault source:** Authored component-local tables; no fault library or separate location pool.

Severity impacts:

- **Minor — Working distortion:** Rig remains operational. Thrust, landing, docking, and collision telemetry produces 25% more Body and Frame strike weight.
- **Major — Load-bearing damage:** High thrust is disabled. Thrust, landing, docking, and collision telemetry produces twice the normal Body and Frame strike weight.
- **Total — Frame failure:** Rig is grounded and the chassis must be replaced.

Minor faults:

| Fault | Repair | Labor | Work grade |
|---|---|---:|:---:|
| Chassis out of square | Square and align chassis | 6 hours | C |
| Crossmember fasteners working loose | Retorque and lock crossmember fasteners | 2 hours | E |
| Frame rail stress cracking | Stop-drill and reinforce frame rail | 5 hours | C |
| Cab cradle shifted | Reset and align cab cradle | 4 hours | D |
| Cargo-spine joint fretting | Rebed and secure cargo-spine joint | 4 hours | D |

Major faults:

| Fault | Repair | Labor | Work grade |
|---|---|---:|:---:|
| Main frame rail cracked through | Plate and weld main frame rail | 12 hours | B |
| Central keel buckled | Straighten and reinforce central keel | 18 hours | A |
| Cargo-spine junction torn | Rebuild cargo-spine junction | 14 hours | B |
| Cab cradle partially separated | Reconstruct and align cab cradle | 12 hours | B |
| Primary crossmember collapsed | Cut out and replace primary crossmember | 10 hours | C |
